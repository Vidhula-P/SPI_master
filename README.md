# SPI master
Verification of Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) master using Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)
- Built a modular UVM verification environment (agent, sequencer, driver, monitors, scoreboard).
- Created constrained-random and directed tests for full-duplex SPI transactions.
- Developed a scoreboard with temporal alignment to ensure accurate master/ slave data correlation.
- Achieved 100% functional coverage.
- Debugged clock-edge and sampling issues, improving data integrity across transfers.
